## 🔐 API Key Setup

This project uses an API key stored securely in `local.properties` and is **not committed** to source control.

### 1. Add your API key

Create (or open) the `local.properties` file in the root of the project and add your own API key:

```properties
TMDB_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

🙏 A Small Note
This is my first time working with Kotlin Multiplatform, so there may be things I haven’t done perfectly.
I’d really appreciate your feedback or guidance — it means a lot as I keep learning and improving!
